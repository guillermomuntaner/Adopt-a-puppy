## :bulb: Motivation and Context
It is my first time using Jetpack, and managed to put something together very quickly, so I am
positively impress by it :)
Something challenging was dealing with the combination of an app bar and jetpack navigation. I
couldn't find a simpler way to do this, so ended up handling it in a particular way, with some state
and passing Handling the navigation; see [Navigation.kt].
